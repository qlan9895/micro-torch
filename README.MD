## Simple Neural Network
This is a implementation of MLP(Multi-Layer Perceptron) from scratch using only `numpy`. 

### Implementation details
Class NeuralNetwork:
- Forward: Should take data x, forward propagate through all layers and output y_pred.
- Backward: Based on loss function (MSE_loss for example), backward_propagate through all layers of neural network and update each weight.
